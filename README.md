# Customer Segmentation Analysis Using Unsupervised Learning

This is a Basic Project that will help one understand Unsupervised Learning in a Brief way. Project-wise learning is one of the most effective ways to learn anything.

## Customer Segmentation

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals who are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests, spending behavior, and more. The goal of customer segmentation is to understand better and meet the unique needs of different customer groups, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences for maximum effectiveness.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is presented with a dataset without labeled responses or targets. Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained on a dataset with explicit labels, unsupervised learning involves extracting patterns, structures, or relationships inherent in the data without predefined categories. Common techniques in unsupervised learning include clustering, where similar data points are grouped, and dimensionality reduction, which aims to reduce the complexity of the dataset while preserving essential features. Unsupervised learning is beneficial for discovering hidden patterns and gaining insights into the intrinsic properties of the data.

## Clustering
Clustering is a process of grouping similar objects; i.e., to partition unlabeled examples into disjoint subsets of clusters, such that:

    1. Examples within a cluster are similar (in this case, we speak of high intraclass similarity).

    2. Examples in different clusters are different (in this case, we speak of low interclass similarity).
Two kinds of inputs can be used for grouping:

- in similarity-based clustering, the input to the algorithm is an n × n dissimilarity matrix or distance matrix;
- in feature-based clustering, the input to the algorithm is an n × D feature matrix or design matrix, where n is the number of examples in the dataset and D the dimensionality of each sample.
Similarity-based clustering allows easy inclusion of domain-specific similarity, while feature-based clustering has the advantage that it is applicable to potentially noisy data.
